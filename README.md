The following are steps to reproduce the codebase for testing mint on Ethereum-based.

If you are supposed to use a public network such as Goerli, you must already have a wallet, in this case, you can easily use Metamask to use it as a wallet. Then:

1. Running react-based app using these commands:
   ```shell
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Then, connect the wallet via connect button
3. Click the Mint button for minting, you must have sufficient GoerliETH for the minting transaction (min. 0.1 gOerliETH), if you don't have any GoerliETH, you can request some GoerliETH from [this](https://goerlifaucet.com)
